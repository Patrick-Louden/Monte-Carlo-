This repository contains sample code for a monte carlo (MC) simulation of argon, as well as an analysis script that computes the radial distribution function (RDF). (Both written in Fortran)

Also included are two (.jpg) images showing examples of what the initial argon crystal and an equilibrated system's RDF should look like.
